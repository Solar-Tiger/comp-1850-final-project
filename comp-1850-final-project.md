## Objective  
You have been hired to build a responsive website for **Audio Engine**, a home audio equipment company. A designer has provided a **desktop mockup**, which you must replicate as closely as possible. In addition, you are responsible for designing and coding the **tablet and mobile layouts**, ensuring they match the style and branding of the desktop version. 

This project will demonstrate your ability to interpret design specifications, apply responsive design principles, and write clean, semantic HTML and CSS.

---

## Project Requirements  

### 1. General Guidelines  
- Your website must be **fully responsive** and function well across screen sizes from **320px to 1920px**.  
- Use a **mobile-first approach**: mobile styles should be the default, with tablet and desktop styles added using `min-width` media queries.  
- Include a **functional show/hide navigation menu** for mobile view.  
- Use **semantic HTML5 elements** appropriately (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).  
- The **desktop layout must match the provided mockup** as closely as possible.  
- Use the file name `index.html` for your main HTML file.  

### 2. Folder Structure  
Organize your project folder as follows:  
- HTML file(s) in the **root directory**  
- Images in an **images/** folder  
- CSS in a **styles/** folder  
- JavaScript in a **scripts/** folder  

### 3. Assets

#### Images

- All required images are provided in the `website-images` folder.  
- **Note:** Not all images in the folder are used in the final design — choose only those that match the mockup.

#### Icons

- Icons used on this website are saved as image files.  
  - You can find all the icons used in the mockup in the `website-images` folder.

#### Fonts

- The mockup uses **Source Sans 3** as the font for all text.  
  - You can find this font on Google Fonts:  
    - <https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+3>  
  - For help including Google Fonts in your website, refer to this guide:  
    - <https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started>  
  - You will need the following weights and styles for Source Sans 3:  
    - 200, 200i (italic), 300, 300i (italic), 400, 400i (italic), 600, 600i (italic), 700, 700i (italic), 900, 900i (italic)

## Use of Generative AI (GenAI)  
- You are **not permitted** to use Generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot) to generate code for this project.  
- You **may** use GenAI tools as a **learning resource** — to ask questions, clarify concepts, or explore examples.  
- **Do not copy and paste AI-generated code** into your project. Doing so may be considered **plagiarism** and could result in academic misconduct penalties.  
- Your project must reflect your **own understanding and effort**. If you're unsure about something, ask your instructor or use AI tools to help you learn — not to do the work for you.

## Tips for Success  
- **Code mobile-first**: make the mobile view your default and build up to larger screens.  
- Plan your **tablet and mobile layouts** before writing your CSS.  
- Test your site on **multiple screen sizes**.  
- Validate your code:  
  - HTML Validator: <https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input>  
  - CSS Validator: <https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input>  
- If you get stuck, try the following:  
  - Ask classmates (e.g., on Discord)  
  - Reach out to your instructor  
  - Use AI tools to help you **understand** the problem — not to write your code
